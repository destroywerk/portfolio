                            <p>Feel free to get in touch to talk about any of my work.</p>
                            <p>I've worked in product design for 14 years and graphic design for 5 years before that. For the last 2 years, I've been working on supporting complex organisational structures at HR SaaS Personio as a Principal Product Designer. Working in large-scale software seems to be where my career keeps orientating as I love finding elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>
                            <p>Previously, I was at Google for 9 years working across mobile, wearables and tablet to launch Android Enterprise, Pixel Watch and Pixel Tablet. I've worked across wearables, tablets, web SaaS, mobile operating systems, B2B mobile Apps, and consumer Apps, and I'm excited about what other places I can help solve problems for people.</p>

                            <p>Other than my most important job of shepherding my 3 wonderful children into good people, I also have other passions for art and music which keep me ticking over (as well as being a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/182134610-tim-green" target="_blank" class="text-link">very keen reader</a>, especially of sci-fi).</p>

                            <p>I studied both Fine Art and Design and have continued producing artwork throughout my career. My latest work is mostly focused on oil paintings and has been both exhibited and collected internationally and at various art fairs.</p>

                            <h3><a href="https://bamboohouseradio.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link-header">Bamboo House Radio</a></h3>
                            <p>I do a monthly radio show with my good friend Martyn Riley on MusicBoxRadio, the 2nd Sunday of every month 11am - 1pm. We do an hour each, alternating who starts, and generally cover ambient, modern classical, found sounds, experimental music or anything that has taken our fancy that month.</p>
